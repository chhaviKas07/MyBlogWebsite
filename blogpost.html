        <p>Over the past few years, I have actually made the intentional move away from following primarily food blogs
            (which too often send me into that old comparison/jealousy/insecurity spiral, meh) and now find myself
            following bloggers in totally different niches — and it has been awesome. I have blog categories on Feedly
            for photographers I admire, cool people working for social justice, interesting perspectives on faith, DIY
            stuff I actually want to try, you name it! Mostly they are just blogs that have nada to do with recipes, and
            I find that I look forward to reading them more than ever. But that said, the blogs in my reader that get
            the most clicks by a landslide are in my favorite category that I have oh-so-creatively named — get ready
            for it — “fun”.

            This is another long-time read for me, and one that I still completely look forward to tuning into daily.
            Her posts are always interesting and fun, and I look forward to her list of links every weekend. Also of
            note — she has really awesome readers, so the comment sections on her posts are usually just as fascinating
            to read as well.

            I have been following Elise's blog since before I even knew what a blog was. (Yeah, way back before blog
            readers, she was a favorite “bookmark” in my browser!) And in that weird way that the internet brings people
            together, I kind of feel like we have “grown up together” over this past decade. Its been fun to watch her
            transition from life as a single graphic designer to falling in love and getting married, having one
            daughter and then another, taking the leap from one creative endeavor to another to another — and sharing
            stories and reflections and photos of it all on her blog along the way. I just really dig the way she thinks
            about and appreciates life, and love her style. Now if only I could make myself finish a scrapbook…

            I hve never met Erin before in person, but goodness, I feel like she is such a kindred spirit.  And I have completely enjoyed tuning into her blog for years (like, so many years now!) for a dose of real-life inspiration and lovely prose.  Her posts on navigating motherhood (with her sweet little toddler) and marriage have always been some of my favorites.  But I have always especially connected with her posts on work, and creativity, and self-care, probably because they are always words I need to take to heart myself.  I also really admire how brave and open she has been to letting her career evolve/change in some big ways over the past decade, and I can not wait to follow along wherever the next roads may lead.
            This is another long-time read for me, and one that I still completely look forward to tuning into daily.  Her posts are always interesting and fun, and I look forward to her list of links every weekend.  Also of note — she has really awesome readers, so the comment sections on her posts are usually just as fascinating to read as well.
            I had always heard people talk about this blog, but did not start following regularly until a year or two ago.  I will be the first to admit that fashion-ish blogs are not usually my thing, but I feel like Emily is really down-to-earth, and posts about trendy things in a fun and helpful and accessible way.  Her beauty tutorials are also always fascinating and spot-on.  More than anything though (I am realizing a theme here…), I love the posts when she shares about her husband, and all of the honest ups and downs of navigating life as a new mom.

            And they are just that — blogs I find fun! Some I have followed for years and years, some are pretty new to
            me. Some deal with 100% light and fluffy stuff, some dig a little deeper into the meat of life. Some of them
            share the most beautiful prose, some are random and chatty and full of incomplete sentences. But I love them
            all, and can genuinely say that I look forward to reading them most mornings (after I read The Skimm, of
            course, which I am still obsessed with), and also genuinely admire each of the bloggers behind them. ♥

            So if any of you are on the prowl for some new non-recipe blogs, I thought I would share 7 of my favorites
            with you today. I am guessing you will be familiar with a few, but I am hoping there might be a few new gems
            in there for you to discover. And hey — if you have some favorites of your own, pretty please share them in
            the comments below, because I totally want to check them out.

            Have “fun”!</p>
